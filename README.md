### Morse Code Encoder/Decoder
This is a web-based tool that allows users to encode and decode Morse code. It also includes support for Arabic characters, though the functionality may not be perfect. The website provides an easy-to-use interface where users can input text and instantly get the encoded or decoded result in Morse code.

### Features:
Encode and Decode Morse Code: Convert any text into Morse code and vice versa.

Support for Arabic Characters: Arabic letters can be encoded and decoded, though there may be some imperfections in the implementation.

Simple and User-Friendly Interface: A straightforward and clean design for quick and easy use.
### Usage:
To Encode: Input any text (including Arabic) in the input box and click the "Encode" button.

To Decode: Input a Morse code string (with spaces between letters) in the input box and click the "Decode" button.

### Notes:

The Arabic support is still a work in progress and might not handle all edge cases perfectly.

Feel free to contribute by improving the Arabic encoding/decoding accuracy or fixing bugs.
